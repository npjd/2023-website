          I&#39;m working at <a href="https://centml.ai/">CentML</a> next term!
          Pretty excited to work alongside
          <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/">Gennady</a> and
          <a href="https://anandj.in/">Anand</a> in Toronto. Excited to do more
          systems + compilers work
        </li>
        <li>
          I helped <a href="https://x.com/sincethestudy">BM</a> with bracket
          bots this term. From

          I started working alongside
          <a href="https://hongzhangblaze.github.io/">Hong Zhang</a> on a LLM
          memory optimization research project — more updates on this soon
        </li>
        <li>
          Got a lot better at recruiting + interviewing —

          I made a pretty awesome halloween costume — I spent all of reading
          week learning blender, 3D printing, and then spray painting to make MF
          Doom&#39;s iconic mask
        </li>
        <li>I started dancing (informally)</li>
        <li>I cooked a lot!</li>
        <li>This was the best term of school by far</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Failures</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I did not do great academically this term. Not terrible, but not the
          best! I was in the thick of it going through CS 245, and PSCYH 101 is
          an elusively hard course. I should&#39;ve stuck to Chinese
        </li>
        <li>
          Not a failure — but I am really going to miss being at school. I
          won&#39;t be back in Waterloo for a while, so I&#39;m in a &quot;you
          don&#39;t know you are in the good old days until you&#39;ve actually
          left them&quot; situation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>2A has been defined by</p>
      <ul>
        <li>random adventures</li>
        <li>random hardships</li>
        <li>random blesses of life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and I am not complaining</p>
      <p>
        I think what I loved about this term has been how serendipitous its
        been. I probably spent a total of 11-13 hours on-campus everyday and
        only 2 hours in my room, time getting to know great people I briefly met
        in first year, and maximizing shenanigans
      </p>
      <p>Some events and photos!</p>
      <p><strong>Banff Trip</strong></p>
      <p>
        This was before the term had started, but this trip was pretty fun. With
        <strong>ML</strong>, <strong>YK</strong>, and <strong>SY</strong> — we
        got a campsite, rented a car, and went on cool nature adventures. The
        highlight was scaling Mt. Fairview (2000 m of elevation gain and
        reaching a max elevation of 3000 m). This was physically the hardest
        thing I&#39;ve done. After getting to a checkpoint 80% of the way, our
        group was about to call it. But my delusional-ass had to be there...

        But we did it! You can do anything, if and only if you want to do it
        (this is the theme of this blog).

        We got to spend some time at the University of Calgary — where I got to
        meet <strong>TM</strong> and <strong>MF</strong>. Awesome time.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Beginning of Term + Recruiting</strong></p>
      <p>
        My living situation was not the best, and I didn&#39;t really get along
        with my roommates (they all seemed to already know eachother, something
        something echo chambers...). So I tried to spend as little time possible
        at my place and as much on campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;d camp out in the STC lecture halls late at night to do leetcode,
        take mid-day naps at the MC comfy, and try to watch the sunset every day
        from E7.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also went to class! Surprise, going to class is good! You see people,
        you are caught up, and, well, you get to use what you pay for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recruiting was also something that went great this term. After the
        terrible performance in 1B, I told myself I wanted to do better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got around 12 interviews from 50 cycle 1 applications — and offers
        from 6 of them. I was really excited to get matched with CentML (my
        first choice).
      </p>
      <p>
        I really wanted to know that I could recruit, interview, write a good
        resume, and, well, be &quot;employable&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did that! Again, all this happened because I wanted it. I wasn&#39;t
        doing this to prove to anyone except me. If you were trying to recruit
        for a job that your parents wanted or that will impress your friends —
        you are essentially cutting your efforts short.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competition is for losers. When you do something you don&#39;t want, you
        are setting yourself up to compete with people who do want it. And guess
        what? They’ll always have the edge over you. Because when the nights get
        late, the challenges mount, and the work gets tougher, they’ll push
        through — not out of obligation, but because they care.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bracket Bots</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>BM</strong> is really smart. He&#39;s also really fun to work
        with. I also think robots are cool, but I&#39;ve never worked with them
        before 😔

        I got to work on custom firmware for chips, getting object detection
        working on Pi5 NPUs, and also stereo depth perception algorithms. A lot
        more work is to be done — so check out

        <li>Sharing a lot of pomegranates with friends</li>
        <li>Staying up doing karaoke in lecture halls</li>
        <li>Running a birthday party</li>
        <li>An eventful potluck...</li>

      <p>I love sharing food with people. I made guacamole a couple of times, de seeded pomegranates, and more — but  it is the people I share it with that make those moments truly special </p>
      <p> Ok that's pretty corny... but hey man... idk what else to say... </p>
      <p><strong>Breakup</strong></p>
      <p>
        I had been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Around October, we
        decided to split up. I learnt a lot though it and also had lots of fun
        with her — but life moves on. It&#39;s not always promised you&#39;ll be
        with someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In life, it&#39;s a privilege to be around good people. If you have good
        parents, good friends, a good significant other, or even a good pet — be
        grateful for it.
      </p>
      <p>Regardless, solitude is an amazing tool for personal growth</p>

      <p><strong>Final Words</strong></p>
      <p>
        This term was the first time the drive back home wasn’t filled with pure
        excitement — it was bittersweet. So much has changed since I started
        college. I hardly recognize the person I was at the beginning of the
        year, and I have no idea what the next one will bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you read my 1B review, it might’ve seemed like I was really unlucky,
        like everything that could go wrong did. But I recently came across the
        <strong>Nova Effect</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It comes from an ancient Taoist story about a farmer who saved up small
        amounts of money and bought a beautiful white horse. The villagers
        admired the horse and told the farmer how lucky he was to own such a
        fine animal. The farmer simply replied, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, the horse ran away. The villagers came to console him, saying
        how unfortunate it was. The farmer only said, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A few weeks later, the horse returned, bringing with it a group of wild
        horses. The villagers were amazed and said,
        <em>“How lucky you are!”</em> But the farmer responded again,
        <em>“Maybe.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after, the farmer’s son tried to tame one of the wild horses, but
        he fell and broke his leg. The villagers rushed over to share their
        sympathies, saying how terrible the accident was. The farmer, as always,
        replied, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not long after, soldiers came through the village, recruiting all the
        able-bodied young men for war. Because of his broken leg, the farmer’s
        son was spared. The villagers told the farmer how fortunate he was, but
        he just said, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I look back on this year, there were a lot of moments that felt
        like the white horse running away. Things I thought were setbacks,
        disappointments, or missed opportunities weighed on me. But sometimes,
        those same moments turned out to be the beginning of something
        better—new friendships, new projects, or new directions I hadn’t
        considered before.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year hasn’t been a straight line, and maybe that’s okay. I’m
        learning to let go of trying to label everything as good or bad.
        Instead, I’m holding onto the idea that the story is still unfolding.
        Sometimes the best things happen because the white horse ran away.

        What&#39;s next other than my co-op? I&#39;m going to be in Boston for a
        weekend in January. Bracketbot hackathon next term will be very fun in
        Waterloo. I am going to try dancing more (there&#39;s a certain club
        I&#39;m really eager to join...). I am also going to plan some more
        events on campus (keep your eyes peeled for a certain contest next
        term...).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have any expectations though. These are just a handful of things I want to do — but there's no guarantee. I will just walk my own path and face my errors.
